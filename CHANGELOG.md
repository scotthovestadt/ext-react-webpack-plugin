# v0.2.12
* Switched to Webpack 2.

# v0.2.7
* Added `production` config.  Set this to true in production environments to compress the generated Ext JS bundle.  Defaults to false.

# v0.2.6
* "theme" config now accepts the path to a custom theme.  See the ext-react-material-ui-boilerplate where we use this to match grid colors to material-ui defaults.
